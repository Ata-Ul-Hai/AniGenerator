# AniGenerator Consumer Flow

This document outlines the proposed User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) journey for consumers using the AniGenerator platform. The goal is to provide a seamless, intuitive, and frictionless experience from content input to the final video download, utilizing our premium frontend architecture, while strictly protecting backend resources.

---

## 1. Landing Page (The Entry Point)
The consumer's journey begins on the AniGenerator Landing Page, which introduces the platform's capabilities with a premium aesthetic.

*   **Key Elements:** High-impact typography, glassmorphism design elements, and a subtle animated background.
*   **Call to Action (CTA):** A prominent **"Start Creating"** or **"Launch Studio"** button that directs the user to the Consumer Input View.
*   *Note for Admins:* The admin login will be moved to a discrete location (e.g., footer) to prioritize the consumer experience.

---

## 2. Input View (Content Submission)
Once the consumer clicks the CTA, they are taken to the Input View, where they provide the source material for their video.

*   **Content Input Methods:**
    *   **Text Field:** A sleek, modern text area for pasting scripts or raw notes.
    *   **File Upload:** A drag-and-drop zone accepting `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` files.
*   **Configuration Options:**
    *   **Scene Count:** A simple slider allowing the user to request a specific number of scenes. *Note: Unauthenticated consumer limits will be strictly capped at a low number (e.g., 3 scenes) to prevent abuse.*
*   **Action:** Clicking **"Generate Animation"** triggers the backend `/upload` (if file) and `/generate/async` endpoints.

---

## 3. Processing View (The Magic Happens)
Video generation involves complex LLM orchestration and rendering. 

*   **Visual Feedback:** A sophisticated loading animation aligns with our premium design system.
*   **Expected Duration:** The typical process takes between **10 to 60 seconds**, depending on the scene count and infrastructure load.
*   **Status Updates:** The frontend continuously polls the `/jobs/{job_id}` endpoint and updates the UI with dynamic status messages (*"Analyzing document...", "Choreographing scenes...", "Rendering whiteboard..."*).
*   **Timeout Handling & Background Processing:**
    *   If a job exceeds the expected duration (e.g., >90 seconds), the UI will gracefully transition to a "Taking longer than expected" state.
    *   **Asynchronous Option:** The UI will provide a session link or an option to enter an email (if implemented) so the user can leave the page and be notified/return later without keeping the browser tab open.

---

## 4. Result View (Playback & Download)
Once the backend completes the render, the UI seamlessly transitions to the Result View.

*   **Video Player:** A custom HTML5 video player prominently displays the final `.mp4` whiteboard animation.
*   **Consumer Actions:**
    *   **Download:** A clear button to save the MP4 artifact directly to their device.
    *   **Create Another:** A button to reset the flow and return to the Input View.

---

## 5. Edge Cases & Failure Handling
To ensure a robust UX, the frontend must explicitly handle the following failure states with clear, user-friendly messaging and recovery options:

*   **Empty / Invalid Input:** 
    *   *Trigger:* User submits without text, or text is gibberish/too short.
    *   *Action:* Client-side validation prevents submission. Server-side validation returns a `400 Bad Request`. UI highlights the text box and prompts for valid content.
*   **Upload Fails:** 
    *   *Trigger:* Network drop, unsupported file type, or file exceeds `MAX_UPLOAD_MB`.
    *   *Action:* UI displays a specific error ("File too large" or "Unsupported format") and falls back to requesting raw text input.
*   **LLM Fails (Gemini API):** 
    *   *Trigger:* Gemini API quota limits, context length exceeded, or upstream service outages.
    *   *Action:* Job status marks as `failed`. UI displays: *"Our AI director is currently overwhelmed. Please try again in a few moments or try a shorter text."*
*   **Render Timeout:** 
    *   *Trigger:* Remotion headless browser crash or FFmpeg stitch failure.
    *   *Action:* UI detects the backend failure state and prompts the user to retry the generation, automatically submitting the cached text.
*   **Job Stuck in Processing:** 
    *   *Trigger:* Polling returns `running` indefinitely (e.g., worker crashed without updating DB).
    *   *Action:* If polling continues beyond a hard limit (e.g., 3 minutes), the UI declares a timeout, stops polling, and provides a "Report Issue" or "Retry" action.

## 6. Security & Cost Management (Public API Protection)
Opening generative pipelines to public consumers introduces a severe risk of **cost explosion** (draining LLM credits and cloud compute). Simply bypassing the admin token is unacceptable. To safely expose the API, the following infrastructure must be implemented:

1.  **Abuse Detection (Bot Prevention):**
    *   Integrate **reCAPTCHA v3** or **Cloudflare Turnstile** on the frontend. The `/generate/async` endpoint must validate this token before accepting the job, preventing automated scripts from burning credits.
2.  **Strict Rate Limiting:**
    *   Implement Redis-backed rate limiting.
    *   **Per IP Limit:** e.g., Maximum 2 generation requests per hour.
    *   **Per Session Limit:** Use browser fingerprinting or HTTP-only cookies to enforce quotas.
3.  **Request Quotas & Hard Caps:**
    *   Set daily budget alerts and hard caps at the Google Cloud API Gateway/Billing level. If the daily budget is hit, the API immediately returns `429 Too Many Requests` or `503 Service Unavailable`, and the UI displays a "Daily Limit Reached" message.
4.  **Resource Throttling for Guests:**
    *   Unauthenticated consumers should be heavily constrained compared to Admins.
    *   Max input text length: Severely reduced.
    *   Max scene count: Locked to 2 or 3 scenes max to minimize LLM context windows and render times.
